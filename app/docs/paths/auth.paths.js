        "This endpoint handles both **login** and **account creation** using a Google account.\n\n" +
        "### 🔐 What It Does:\n" +
        "- Redirects the user to Google for authentication\n" +
        "- After a successful login, the user is redirected back to the provided `redirect` URL with a token and email\n" +
        "- If the user doesn't exist in the shop's database, a new user account is created automatically\n\n" +
        "### 📥 Required Parameters:\n" +
        "- `redirect`: The full frontend URL to redirect to after authentication (must be a registered shop domain)\n" +
        "- `shop_id`: The numeric ID of the shop in your system\n\n" +
        "### 🔁 Response Behavior:\n" +
        "- Redirects to `redirect` URL with query parameters:\n" +
        "  - `token`: JWT containing user info\n" +
        "  - `email`: Authenticated user’s email\n\n" +
        "### ⚠️ Frontend Responsibilities:\n" +
        "The frontend must read the token and shop it securely (preferably in an HTTP-only cookie).\n\n" +
        "Example logic:\n" +
        "```js\n" +
        "const params = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);\n" +
        'const token = params.get("token");\n' +
        'const email = params.get("email");\n\n' +
        "if (token) {\n" +
        "  document.cookie = `auth_token=${token}; path=/; Secure; SameSite=Strict`;\n" +
        '  window.location.href = "/dashboard";\n' +
        "}\n" +
        "```\n\n" +
        "The cookie will then be sent with all authenticated requests automatically.\n\n" +
        "🆕 If the user is signing in for the first time, their account will be created on-the-fly, using data from their Google profile.",
